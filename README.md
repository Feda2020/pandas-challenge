## Description
Analyzing the city's school district to help the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.
We analyzed the district-wide standardized test results using Pandas, data frames, format, grouping and other features offered by Panda to help look for trends and the relationship between school type, budget, scores, size and grad.

### District Summary

Calculating the following and then create a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame.
Include the following:
* Total number of unique schools
* Total students
* Total budget
* Average math score
* Average reading score
* % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
* % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
* % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)


### School Summary

Calculating the following and then create a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame.
Include the following:
* School name
* School type
* Total students
* Total school budget
* Per student budget
* Average math score
* Average reading score
* % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
* % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
* % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

### Schools Performance 

Then using Panda and the calculation features to calculation and create a DataFrame that summarizes the following key metrics about each school:
* Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
* Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
* Math Scores by Grade
* Reading Scores by Grade
* Scores by School Spending
* Scores by School Size
